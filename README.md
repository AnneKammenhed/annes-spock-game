<h2>Features</h2>
The page consists of a header with the logo, a div with the game area and a footer with scores. 

The game area has five images that when clicked run the game. 

Underneath the images there is a message with the outcome of the game is visible - who wins? - who loses? 

The footer adds up the wins for the player and the computer.

<h2>Bugs</h2>
To be able to follow the logic step by step and learn along the way, I wanted to bild the game with an if-else-statement. Since I couldn't get the code to work with the five options, I built out a game with only two options first. Link to that code below.

<h2>Credits</h2>
The site is built on the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. Inspiration has been taken from the love maths project and the rock, paper, scissors game provided by the Code Institute. I also browsed thoruh some other games on github to get some inspiration.
